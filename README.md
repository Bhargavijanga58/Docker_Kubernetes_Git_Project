Welcome to the Docker and Kubernetes Git Project repository! This project serves as a demonstration of seamlessly integrating Docker and Kubernetes within a Git environment. Our primary objective revolves around the containerization of web applications, deployed on Rancher Kubernetes. We've also implemented automated builds and deployments through the powerful combination of GitHub and Jenkins (CI/CD).
